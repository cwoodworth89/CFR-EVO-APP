## 🧭 Routing Engine & Pathfinding Anomalies

### 1. Erratic Routing Loops & Intra-Municipal Path Preference
> **Status**: ⚠️ **Still open.** Turn-by-turn routing functions, but OSRM Lua profile arterial-vs-alleyway weighting has not been re-tuned.
* **Incident / Path**: `1300 Pinetree Way` (Town Centre Fire Hall / Hall 1) $\rightarrow$ `428 Nelson St`.
* **Reported Behavior**:
  * The calculated apparatus route exhibits erratic pathing with unnatural loops, parking lot / back-alley cut-throughs, and unnecessary detours (see visual trace below).
  * The route leaves optimal arterial corridors and may exit municipal bounds unnecessarily.
* **Root Cause Investigation Needed**:
  * Inspect OSRM Lua emergency profile weighting (`osrm/profiles/emergency.lua` or local OSRM graph).
  * Check OSM road classification weights (e.g. `service`, `parking_aisle`, `residential` vs `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary`).
  * Check snap distance / nearest-road snapping logic for origins and destinations near complex driveways or hall aprons.
  * Evaluate weighting penalty for crossing municipal boundaries: prioritize staying inside Coquitlam city limits on intra-city calls where possible.
* **Visual Reference Trace**:
  ```
  Origin: 1300 Pinetree Way (Hall 1 Apron)
  Target: 428 Nelson St
  Issue: Bizarre loops, erratic turns, sub-optimal road class snapping
  ```

### 2. Intersection Geocoding & Hardcoded Port Moody Fallback (`DISP-2026-F1F345`)
> **Status**: ✅ **Resolved (2026-08-20).** The prior "fix" only swapped the Port Moody coordinates for Coquitlam City Centre — still a silent guess, and a more dangerous one because it renders as a fully valid in-coverage dispatch. All hardcoded coordinate fallbacks have now been removed frontend-wide; unresolved coordinates stay `null` and surface the CLAUDE.md §5 Tier 1 warning with routing suppressed.
* **Incident**: `CHRISTMAS WAY AND WESTWOOD ST` (Grid 68, Motor Vehicle Incident).
* **Observed Problem**:
  * The call routed from Hall 1 all the way out into **Port Moody** (`49.27305, -122.88452`).
  * The Cadastral Block & Satellite PIPs were blank (outside Coquitlam municipal tile boundary).
  * Street View was unable to resolve facade.
* **Root Cause Identified**:
  * The dispatch target had `target.lat: null, target.lng: null` because intersection geocoding did not resolve `Christmas Way and Westwood St`.
  * When `lat`/`lng` is null, `App.jsx` (`handleSimulateCall`) and `SimulationControl.jsx` fell back to hardcoded coordinates `49.27305, -122.88452` (Port Moody).
  * OSRM faithfully routed to the Port Moody coordinates, and tile servers have no data outside Coquitlam.
* **Action Required**:
  1. Add authoritative Coquitlam arterial intersection coordinates for `Christmas Way & Westwood St` (`49.2783, -122.7935`) and audit intersection dictionary.
  2. Fix `App.jsx` and `SimulationControl.jsx` fallback coordinates to use verified City Center coordinates (`49.2838, -122.7907`), never out-of-city coordinates.

### 3. Missing `responding_units` in Replayed Dispatches
> **Status**: ✅ **Confirmed fixed** — independently verified in `App.jsx`; `verified_units` → `responding_units` → `[]` resolution is passed through explicitly. The `['SQ1','E1','L1']` invented-apparatus fallbacks have additionally been removed from `EVORoutingEngine.js`, `RouteOverviewPanel.jsx`, and `MapBoard.jsx`.
* **Observed Problem**: Simulated calls in Kiosk view display `SQ1, E1, L1` regardless of what units were dispatched (e.g. `DISP-2026-F1F345` had `E1, E2, R2, C8`).
* **Root Cause**: `handleSimulateCall` in `frontend/src/App.jsx` omitted `responding_units: call.verified_units || call.responding_units || []` when building `mockCall`, causing `EVORoutingEngine.js` to trigger its `['SQ1', 'E1', 'L1']` fallback.
* **Fix**: Pass `responding_units` explicitly in `App.jsx`.

## 🎨 Kiosk & Review Panel UI/UX Refinements

### 4. Remove Satellite View from Call Review Panel
> **Status**: ✅ Reported fixed — `SatelliteMiniMap.jsx` deleted entirely (removed as an orphaned component alongside the v1.0.0 training-mode cleanup, commit `d5fbdcc`).

* **Observed Problem**: `VerificationSidebar.jsx` includes a `<SatelliteMiniMap />` component that was never intended in the plan. When target coordinates are missing, it persistently defaults to pinning at Burlington Ave & Pinetree Way (`49.2838, -122.7932`).
* **Fix**: Remove `SatelliteMiniMap` from `VerificationSidebar.jsx`.

### 5. Audio Player Simplification in Call Review Panel
> **Status**: ✅ Reported fixed — `AudioWaveformPlayer.jsx` deleted; reverted to native audio controls (also removed alongside commit `d5fbdcc`).

* **Observed Problem**: The custom canvas-based `AudioWaveformPlayer` is overly complex; user prefers a simple, clean, dependable native audio player.
* **Fix**: Revert to the clean, streamlined audio player in `VerificationSidebar.jsx`.

## 🛣️ Road Closure Ingestion

### 6. Verify first live ingest through the new PostGIS path
> **Status**: ⚠️ **Open — unverified.** The PostGIS rewrite (`206af55`) is deployed and the
> API is healthy, but no full ingest cycle has been observed since. A forced sync POST
> timed out during the deploy session, so the daily scheduled run is the first real test.

* **What changed**: `road_closure_service.py` now resolves zones and municipal
  containment via `ST_Intersects` / `ST_Contains` against `public.city_boundary` and
  `public.zones`, instead of ray-casting over `zones.json`. Closures with unparseable
  geometry are now **dropped** rather than pinned to a placeholder coordinate.
* **How to verify** — check the ingest actually ran and succeeded:
  ```bash
  # 1. Did a sync run, and when?
  ssh tcfire@100.95.146.94 "docker logs cfr_api 2>&1 | grep -i 'differentials-synced' | tail -5"

  # 2. Freshness: updated_at should be within the last 24h (check_and_sync_if_stale
  #    uses max_age_seconds=86400)
  ssh tcfire@100.95.146.94 "docker exec cfr_postgres sh -c 'psql -U \$POSTGRES_USER -d \$POSTGRES_DB -c \"
    SELECT max(updated_at) AS last_sync,
           now() - max(updated_at) AS age,
           count(*) FILTER (WHERE active) AS active_closures
    FROM public.road_closures;\"'"

  # 3. Did the new columns populate? hall_id and geom should be non-null on
  #    freshly-synced active rows.
  ssh tcfire@100.95.146.94 "docker exec cfr_postgres sh -c 'psql -U \$POSTGRES_USER -d \$POSTGRES_DB -c \"
    SELECT hall_id, count(*) AS closures,
           count(geom) AS with_geometry
    FROM public.road_closures WHERE active
    GROUP BY hall_id ORDER BY hall_id NULLS LAST;\"'"
  ```
* **Pass criteria**:
  - `last_sync` age < 24h, and a `differentials-synced` line appears in the API log.
  - Active closure count is non-zero and in the same order of magnitude as the previous
    103 — a large drop would suggest the new containment check is over-filtering.
  - `hall_id` is populated (1–4) on most rows; a large `NULL` group means centroid
    containment is failing and needs review.
  - `with_geometry` equals `closures` — a shortfall means the `geom` mirror UPDATE is
    not firing.
* **Watch for**: closures legitimately spanning the city edge. `is_within_city` uses
  `ST_Intersects` (touching counts), not `ST_Contains`, so a boundary-straddling closure
  should still be admitted. If those disappear, the check is too strict.
