# CFR EVO: Final Phase Debug & QA Punch List

This document tracks identified bugs, routing anomalies, edge cases, and feature refinements to investigate and resolve during the final bug squashing and testing phase.

## 🧭 Routing Engine & Pathfinding Anomalies

### 1. Erratic Routing Loops & Intra-Municipal Path Preference
* **Incident / Path**: `1300 Pinetree Way` (Town Centre Fire Hall / Hall 1) $\rightarrow$ `428 Nelson St`.
* **Reported Behavior**:
  * The calculated apparatus route exhibits erratic pathing with unnatural loops, parking lot / back-alley cut-throughs, and unnecessary detours (see visual trace below).
  * The route leaves optimal arterial corridors and may exit municipal bounds unnecessarily.
* **Root Cause Investigation Needed**:
  * Inspect OSRM Lua emergency profile weighting (`osrm/profiles/emergency.lua` or local OSRM graph).
  * Check OSM road classification weights (e.g. `service`, `parking_aisle`, `residential` vs `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary`).
  * Check snap distance / nearest-road snapping logic for origins and destinations near complex driveways or hall aprons.
  * Evaluate weighting penalty for crossing municipal boundaries: prioritize staying inside Coquitlam city limits on intra-city calls where possible.
* **Visual Reference Trace**:
  ```
  Origin: 1300 Pinetree Way (Hall 1 Apron)
  Target: 428 Nelson St
  Issue: Bizarre loops, erratic turns, sub-optimal road class snapping
  ```

### 2. Intersection Geocoding & Hardcoded Port Moody Fallback (`DISP-2026-F1F345`)
* **Incident**: `CHRISTMAS WAY AND WESTWOOD ST` (Grid 68, Motor Vehicle Incident).
* **Observed Problem**:
  * The call routed from Hall 1 all the way out into **Port Moody** (`49.27305, -122.88452`).
  * The Cadastral Block & Satellite PIPs were blank (outside Coquitlam municipal tile boundary).
  * Street View was unable to resolve facade.
* **Root Cause Identified**:
  * The dispatch target had `target.lat: null, target.lng: null` because intersection geocoding did not resolve `Christmas Way and Westwood St`.
  * When `lat`/`lng` is null, `App.jsx` (`handleSimulateCall`) and `SimulationControl.jsx` fell back to hardcoded coordinates `49.27305, -122.88452` (Port Moody).
  * OSRM faithfully routed to the Port Moody coordinates, and tile servers have no data outside Coquitlam.
* **Action Required**:
  1. Add authoritative Coquitlam arterial intersection coordinates for `Christmas Way & Westwood St` (`49.2783, -122.7935`) and audit intersection dictionary.
  2. Fix `App.jsx` and `SimulationControl.jsx` fallback coordinates to use verified City Center coordinates (`49.2838, -122.7907`), never out-of-city coordinates.

### 3. Missing `responding_units` in Simulated Dispatches
* **Observed Problem**: Simulated calls in Kiosk view display `SQ1, E1, L1` regardless of what units were dispatched (e.g. `DISP-2026-F1F345` had `E1, E2, R2, C8`).
* **Root Cause**: `handleSimulateCall` in `frontend/src/App.jsx` omitted `responding_units: call.verified_units || call.responding_units || []` when building `mockCall`, causing `EVORoutingEngine.js` to trigger its `['SQ1', 'E1', 'L1']` fallback.
* **Fix**: Pass `responding_units` explicitly in `App.jsx`.

## 🎨 Kiosk & Review Panel UI/UX Refinements

### 4. Remove Satellite View from Call Review Panel
* **Observed Problem**: `VerificationSidebar.jsx` includes a `<SatelliteMiniMap />` component that was never intended in the plan. When target coordinates are missing, it persistently defaults to pinning at Burlington Ave & Pinetree Way (`49.2838, -122.7932`).
* **Fix**: Remove `SatelliteMiniMap` from `VerificationSidebar.jsx`.

### 5. Audio Player Simplification in Call Review Panel
* **Observed Problem**: The custom canvas-based `AudioWaveformPlayer` is overly complex; user prefers a simple, clean, dependable native audio player.
* **Fix**: Revert to the clean, streamlined audio player in `VerificationSidebar.jsx`.
