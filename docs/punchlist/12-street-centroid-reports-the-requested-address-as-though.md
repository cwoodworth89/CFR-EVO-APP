## 12. Street centroid reports the requested address as though exact
> **Status**: ⚠️ **Open — re-confirmed in the working tree 2026-08-21.** Both overwrites are
> still present: `geocoder.py:170–174` (step 5, street centroid) and `:177–181` (step 6,
> road centroid). Unchanged since the item was written.

`geocoder.py` step 5 overwrites the result address with the address that was asked for:

```python
result = self.address.resolve_street_centroid(parsed.street, parsed.street_type)
if result:
    result['address'] = f"{parsed.house} {parsed.raw}".strip().title() if parsed.house else result['address']
```

So a whole-street average is displayed as "3080 Gordon Ave" — indistinguishable on
screen from an exact parcel match apart from the confidence score. Step 6 (road centroid)
does the same.

The step 4b nearest-civic resolver added 2026-08-21 deliberately does **not** do this: it
reports the parcel actually used, keeps the dispatched string in `requested_address`, and
explains the substitution in `resolution_note`. Steps 5 and 6 should follow that pattern.
